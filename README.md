# SC_DRG-bulk_single_spatial
Codes for integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-Sequencing uncovering neuropathic pain-associated molecular pathological characteristics in the mouse spinal cord. The raw sequence data of the spatial transcriptomics sequencing, snRNA‚Äêseq, and bulk RNA-seq have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive at National Genomics Data Center China, National Center for Bioinformation / Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (GSA: CRA011548) that are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa.
